        Hi i'm Anthony, I'm a long time tech enthusiast in the midst of an
        exciting career transition from Logistics/IT to Full Stack Development.
        With a strong background in logistics and IT hardware management, I've
        developed a solid foundation in problem-solving, organizational skills,
        and a keen eye for detail. Now, I'm channeling my passion for technology
        and programming to embark on a journey in Full Stack Development.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recently graduated from Ironhack's Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp,
        where I immersed myself in the world of Full Stack Development. This
        program equipped me with a range of skills, like JavaScript, React.js,
        Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB and more. I'm excited to grow this
        knowledge as I embark on my new career path. As I transition into Full
        Stack Development, I'm thrilled about the endless possibilities and
        challenges that await. My strong foundation in Logistics & IT and my
        growing expertise in development will undoubtedly enable me to tackle
        complex problems and contribute to innovative solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        I invite you to
        connect with me as I make this career transition and explore
        opportunities for collaboration or networking in the exciting world of
        tech.
